# SHA256Tracer
Zero Knowledge Demo of SHA 256 Internal State Maniplulation on Standard FIPS SHA

This is simply a script that is a standard implementation of SHA 256, compliant to the FIPS version. The code will run SHA256 normally but with trace Round 13 and print it, it continues to calculate the final hash as well for verification that there is no modifications to the code. This code will not show how I came up with these inputs, but will only prove that the inputs I have gotten are significant.

This demo will be used as a showcase to my credibility to my claim that I have a full SHA 2 Reversal engine (not preimage). That can be used on unsealing TPMs, private crypto keys, VPN handshakes, decrypted encrypted channels, relay attacks, and much more. (This will not affect bitcoin mining). I will not be sharing any information about it as it is proprietary information. 

I will provide a few examples of picking arbitrary values and collisions with the same arbitrary values. Make sure to copy and paste correctly without spacing errors or else the program will hash something completely different.
